  "overview": "An event filterer that selectively filters SendPacket events based on packet type. This class allows you to create event listeners that only trigger for specific types of outgoing packets, reducing unnecessary event processing and improving performance.\n\nFilterers are used with event listeners to control which events trigger your handler functions. The FiltererSendPacket specifically works with the SendPacket event to filter based on the packet type name.",
