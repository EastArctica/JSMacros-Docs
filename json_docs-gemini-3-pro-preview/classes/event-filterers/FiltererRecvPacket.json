  "description": "The FiltererRecvPacket class is an event filterer designed specifically for filtering RecvPacket events based on packet type. This filterer allows you to create event listeners that only trigger for specific types of incoming packets from the server, providing fine-grained control over network-level event handling.",
  "overview": "FiltererRecvPacket works by examining the type field of EventRecvPacket instances and only allowing events that match the specified packet type to pass through. This is particularly useful when you want to monitor or intercept specific network packets without being overwhelmed by the high frequency of all incoming packets.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. Performance: Packet events fire very frequently. Always use specific filters when possible to avoid performance impact.\n2. Packet Names: Packet type names are case-sensitive and correspond to the internal Minecraft packet identifiers.\n3. Null Filter: When type is set to null, the filterer will match all RecvPacket events.\n4. Event Cancellation: This filterer only controls which events trigger your listeners. It doesn't affect packet cancellation.\n5. Network Impact: Be cautious when logging or processing packets extensively.",
