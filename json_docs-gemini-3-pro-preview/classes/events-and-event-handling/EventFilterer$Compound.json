  "overview": "The `EventFilterer$Compound` interface is a specialized interface within the EventFilterer system that defines filters capable of being combined with other filters using logical operations. This interface is implemented by filter classes that can participate in complex filtering compositions, allowing scripts to create sophisticated event filtering logic using AND, OR, and NOT operations.\n\nFilters implementing this interface can be combined using methods like `JsMacros.createComposedEventFilterer()` and `JsMacros.invertEventFilterer()`, enabling the creation of compound filters that can evaluate multiple conditions simultaneously. This is essential for building complex event processing systems that need to handle multiple criteria in a single, efficient filter operation.",
