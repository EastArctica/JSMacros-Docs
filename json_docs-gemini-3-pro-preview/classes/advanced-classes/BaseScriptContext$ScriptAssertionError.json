  "description": "The ScriptAssertionError class is a specialized exception used within JSMacros for script-level assertions and control flow. Unlike traditional errors that indicate failures, ScriptAssertionError is primarily used for intentional script termination, conditional execution, and flow control mechanisms. It provides a way to stop script execution predictably while distinguishing intentional stops from actual errors.",
  "overview": "The ScriptAssertionError class serves as a controlled exception mechanism for JSMacros scripts, enabling:\n\n- Intentional script termination with specific messages\n- Conditional script execution based on runtime conditions\n- Flow control for complex script logic\n- Distinguishing between errors and intentional script stops\n- Integration with JSMacros' error handling and logging systems\n\nThis exception is typically not shown to users as an error but is instead handled internally by the JSMacros system as a normal part of script execution flow.",
