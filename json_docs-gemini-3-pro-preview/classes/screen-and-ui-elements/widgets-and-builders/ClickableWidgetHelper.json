  "description": "The ClickableWidgetHelper class is a foundational wrapper for clickable UI widgets in JSMacros that provides common functionality for buttons and other interactive screen elements. This class serves as a base for more specific widget helpers and offers essential methods for positioning, sizing, text management, state control, and user interaction handling.",
  "overview": "The ClickableWidgetHelper abstracts the complexity of working with Minecraft's native clickable widgets while providing a consistent API for JSMacros scripts. It handles common widget operations like mouse interactions, tooltip rendering, positioning, and state management.\n\nKey Features:\n- Generic type system for type-safe method chaining\n- Position and dimension management with pixel precision\n- Text labeling with support for both string and TextHelper objects\n- Active/inactive state control for user interaction\n- Comprehensive tooltip system with multiple content types\n- Mouse interaction simulation with programmatic clicking\n- Integration with JSMacros rendering and screen systems\n- Z-index control for proper layering in complex UIs\n\nClass Declaration and Type Parameters:\nClickableWidgetHelper<B, T>\n\nWhere:\nB - The specific helper subclass (for method chaining)\nT - The underlying Minecraft widget type\n\nThe class implements RenderElement and Alignable<B>.",
