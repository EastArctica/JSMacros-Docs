  "description": "The ChatHistoryManager class provides comprehensive control over the Minecraft chat history system in JSMacros. It allows script writers to read, modify, insert, and remove chat messages from both the received message history and sent message history.",
  "overview": "The `ChatHistoryManager` manages two types of chat history:\n\n- **Received Messages:** Messages that appear in the chat HUD (from server, system messages, etc.)\n- **Sent Messages:** Messages that the player has typed and sent (accessed via up/down arrows in chat)\n\nThe manager provides thread-safe operations for accessing and modifying the chat history, with proper handling of Minecraft's client thread execution requirements.\n\n### Obtaining the ChatHistoryManager\n\nThe ChatHistoryManager is obtained through the Chat API:\n\n```javascript\n// Get the chat history manager\nconst chatHistory = Chat.getHistory();\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Thread Safety:** All operations that modify chat history are automatically thread-safe and properly execute on Minecraft's client thread.\n\n2. **Index Order:** Index 0 always refers to the most recent message in the history.\n\n3. **Performance Considerations:**\n   - Large chat histories can impact performance\n   - Use the `await` parameter for operations where timing is critical\n   - Consider limiting history size with periodic cleanup\n\n4. **Chat Display Updates:** Always call `refreshVisible()` after inserting or removing messages if you want the changes to be immediately visible in the chat UI.\n\n5. **Sent History:** The `getSent()` method returns a direct reference to the list, so modifications affect the actual sent message history used by Minecraft's chat input.\n\n6. **Time Ticks:** Creation ticks use Minecraft's game tick system (20 ticks per second). Convert to real time using: `realTimeMs = ticks * 50`.\n\n7. **Message Persistence:** Changes to chat history are not persistent across game restarts or world changes.\n\n8. **Event Filtering:** The chat history manager works well with chat-related events for real-time monitoring and filtering.",
