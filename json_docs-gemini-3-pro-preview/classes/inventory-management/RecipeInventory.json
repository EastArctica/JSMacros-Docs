  "description": "The `RecipeInventory` class is an abstract base class for inventory management screens that support crafting, such as crafting tables, furnaces, and the player inventory crafting grid. It provides access to crafting-related functionality including recipe book management, recipe discovery, and crafting grid interaction. This class extends the base `Inventory` class with specialized methods for recipe-based crafting interfaces.",
  "overview": "The `RecipeInventory` class provides comprehensive access to crafting inventory features:\n\n- Access to crafting grid dimensions and slot contents\n- Recipe book integration and management\n- Recipe discovery and filtering capabilities\n- Input/output slot interaction\n- Support for both craftable and all available recipes\n- Integration with crafting tables, furnaces, and player inventory\n\n## Inheritance\n\nThis class is abstract and serves as a base for specific recipe inventory implementations:\n- `CraftingInventory` - For crafting table screens\n- `FurnaceInventory` - For furnace and smelter screens\n- `PlayerInventory` - For player inventory crafting grid\n\n## Important Notes\n\n### Recipe Book Integration\n- Recipe book functionality requires the screen to support recipe book widgets\n- Not all recipe inventories may have recipe book support\n- Recipe discovery may require the recipe book to be initialized and refreshed\n\n### Thread Safety\n- Recipe discovery methods may require thread synchronization\n- These methods can throw `InterruptedException` if interrupted\n- Recipe list refreshing happens on the main thread when needed\n\n### Inventory Types\n- This is an abstract class - you'll work with concrete implementations\n- Different inventory types have different crafting grid sizes and capabilities\n- Some methods may behave differently based on the specific inventory type\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- Recipe discovery can be computationally intensive\n- Consider caching recipe lists when using them frequently\n- Large recipe collections may take time to process",
