  "description": "Represents a ghast entity in the world. GhastEntityHelper provides access to ghast-specific behaviors, particularly their shooting state.",
  "overview": "GhastEntityHelper provides access to ghast-specific behaviors, particularly their shooting state which determines when they are about to fire explosive fireballs at players. Ghasts are large, floating, white-colored hostile mobs found exclusively in the Nether that are known for their distinctive crying sounds and devastating fireball attacks.\n\nGhasts are one of the most dangerous Nether mobs due to their ability to shoot explosive fireballs from a distance. They float through the air and will attack players on sight, opening their eyes and mouths to charge up before firing a fireball. This helper provides access to their current shooting state, which is crucial for predicting attacks and timing defensive maneuvers or counter-attacks.\n\nThis class extends MobEntityHelper and inherits all methods for health, AI control, movement, and other mob properties, while adding ghast-specific functionality for attack state monitoring.",
