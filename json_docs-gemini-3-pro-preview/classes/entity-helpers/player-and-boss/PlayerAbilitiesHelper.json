  "description": "The PlayerAbilitiesHelper class provides access to a player's ability settings and properties in Minecraft.",
  "overview": "The PlayerAbilitiesHelper class provides access to a player's ability settings and properties in Minecraft. This helper allows scripts to read and modify various player abilities such as flying, creative mode, invulnerability, movement speeds, and world modification permissions. It wraps Minecraft's native PlayerAbilities class and exposes both getter and setter methods for common player ability modifications.\n\nThis class is commonly accessed through player-related events or by directly querying the player object, making it essential for scripts that need to modify or monitor player capabilities.",
