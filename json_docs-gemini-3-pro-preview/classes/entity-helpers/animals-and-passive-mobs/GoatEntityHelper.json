  "overview": "The GoatEntityHelper class provides specialized access to goat entities in Minecraft, offering methods to monitor goat-specific behaviors such as screaming states and horn status. This class extends AnimalEntityHelper and inherits all functionality for animals including breeding mechanics, food preferences, and animal compatibility checking.\n\nThis helper is particularly useful for creating scripts that manage goat farming, monitor goat behavior patterns, track horn status for collection purposes, or coordinate with multiple goats in mountain environments.",
