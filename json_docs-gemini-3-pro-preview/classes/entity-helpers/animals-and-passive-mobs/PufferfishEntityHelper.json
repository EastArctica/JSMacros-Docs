  "description": "The PufferfishEntityHelper class provides specialized access to pufferfish entities in Minecraft, offering methods for monitoring and controlling their unique inflation mechanics.",
  "overview": "This class extends FishEntityHelper, inheriting comprehensive fish functionality while providing specific methods for pufferfish behaviors such as size/inflation state management.\n\nPufferfish are unique among Minecraft mobs due to their inflation mechanic - they can deflate (normal state), partially inflate (defensive state), or fully inflate (maximum defensive state). This helper is essential for scripts that need to monitor pufferfish behavior, track defensive states, or implement underwater automation systems where pufferfish presence and states are relevant.",
