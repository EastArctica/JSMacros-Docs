  "description": "The EndCrystalEntityHelper class provides specialized methods for interacting with End Crystal entities in Minecraft.",
  "overview": "End Crystals are decorative and functional entities that can be found naturally in the End dimension or placed by players. They serve both as powerful explosive devices (with a blast radius larger than TNT) and as focusing mechanisms for respawning the Ender Dragon.\n\nEnd Crystals have several unique properties that distinguish them from other entities: naturally generated crystals in the End dimension feature a bedrock base that makes them indestructible to normal means, while player-placed crystals lack this protection. Additionally, End Crystals can emit a beam of energy when targeting specific block positions, typically used for healing the Ender Dragon during boss fights.\n\nThis helper provides access to key End Crystal behaviors including determining whether a crystal is naturally generated (with bedrock base) or player-placed, and accessing the crystal's beam target location if it's actively focusing on a block.\n\nThis class extends EntityHelper and inherits all methods for position, movement, entity properties, and other general entity functionality, while adding End Crystal-specific features.",
