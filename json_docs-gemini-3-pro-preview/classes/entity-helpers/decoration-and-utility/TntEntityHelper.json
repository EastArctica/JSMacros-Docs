  "overview": "The `TntEntityHelper` class is a specialized wrapper for Minecraft TNT entities, providing access to TNT-specific properties and behaviors such as fuse time, explosion power, and priming state. TNT entities are explosive blocks that can be primed to explode after a countdown period, and this helper class allows scripts to monitor, predict, and interact with TNT explosions for various purposes including building, demolition, mining, and explosive automation.\n\nTNT entities are created when TNT blocks are activated (through fire, redstone, or other means) and exist in the world for a short duration before exploding. This helper provides access to the current fuse time, allowing scripts to predict explosion timing, calculate safe distances, and implement various TNT-related mechanics.",
