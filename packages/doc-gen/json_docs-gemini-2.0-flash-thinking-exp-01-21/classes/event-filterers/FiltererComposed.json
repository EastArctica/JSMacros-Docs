  "description": "The `FiltererComposed` class is a powerful event filtering utility that allows you to combine multiple event filters using logical AND and OR operations. This enables complex filtering logic for JSMacros events, giving you fine-grained control over which events trigger your scripts.",
  "overview": "FiltererComposed implements the `EventFilterer.Compound` interface and serves as a composite filter that can combine multiple individual filters. It uses a logical structure where:\n\n- **AND operations**: All filters in a group must pass for the group to pass\n- **OR operations**: Any group can pass for the entire filter to pass\n\nThis structure allows you to create sophisticated filtering conditions like \"filter events where (condition A AND condition B) OR (condition C AND condition D)\".",
