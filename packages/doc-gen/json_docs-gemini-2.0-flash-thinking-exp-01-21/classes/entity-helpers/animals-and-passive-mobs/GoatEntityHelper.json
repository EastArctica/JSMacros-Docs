  "description": "The `GoatEntityHelper` class provides specialized access to goat entities in Minecraft, offering methods to monitor goat-specific behaviors such as screaming states and horn status. This class extends `AnimalEntityHelper` and inherits all functionality for animals including breeding mechanics, food preferences, and animal compatibility checking.",
  "overview": "This helper is particularly useful for creating scripts that manage goat farming, monitor goat behavior patterns, track horn status for collection purposes, or coordinate with multiple goats in mountain environments.",
