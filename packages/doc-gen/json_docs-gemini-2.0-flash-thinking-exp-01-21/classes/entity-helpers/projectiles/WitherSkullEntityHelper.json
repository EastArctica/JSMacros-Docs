  "description": "The `WitherSkullEntityHelper` class provides specialized access to wither skull entities in Minecraft, offering methods to monitor and interact with wither skull-specific behaviors such as charged state detection. This class extends `EntityHelper` and inherits all functionality for entities including position tracking, movement monitoring, and world interaction.",
  "overview": "This helper is particularly useful for creating scripts that detect wither skull projectiles, monitor their behavior patterns, track dangerous skulls, or analyze combat scenarios involving withers or wither skull dispensers.",

      "signature": "WitherSkullEntityHelper()",
      "description": "WitherSkullEntityHelper instances are not typically created directly by scripters. Instead, they are obtained through:\n- Entity-related events (e.g., `EntitySpawn`, `ProjectileHit`, `EntityHurt`)\n- World entity queries using type filtering for \"minecraft:wither_skull\"\n- Casting from generic EntityHelper instances when dealing with wither skull entities",
