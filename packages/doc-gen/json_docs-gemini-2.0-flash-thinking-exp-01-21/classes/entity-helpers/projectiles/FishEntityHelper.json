  "description": "The `FishEntityHelper` class provides specialized access to fish entities in Minecraft, offering methods to monitor and interact with fish-specific behaviors such as bucket origins and aquatic movement patterns. This class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all functionality for mob entities including AI states, pathfinding, and combat behaviors.",
  "overview": "This helper is particularly useful for creating scripts that manage aquarium systems, monitor fish populations, track bucket-released fish versus naturally spawned fish, or coordinate with fishing automation systems. It also serves as the base class for more specialized fish helpers like `TropicalFishEntityHelper` and `PufferfishEntityHelper`.",
