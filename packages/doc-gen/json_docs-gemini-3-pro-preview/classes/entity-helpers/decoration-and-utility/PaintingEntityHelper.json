  "description": "The PaintingEntityHelper class provides specialized access to Minecraft painting entities, allowing you to inspect various properties of paintings in the world.",
  "overview": "Paintings are decorative entities that display artwork on walls and come in various sizes and designs. This helper extends the base EntityHelper class and adds specific functionality for querying painting dimensions and identifying the artwork being displayed.\n\nPaintings in Minecraft come in 26 different art variants as of recent versions, each with unique dimensions and themes. They can be found naturally generated in structures like villages, strongholds, mansions, and ocean monuments, or placed by players. This helper allows you to programmatically identify and analyze paintings in your scripts for various purposes like gallery management, art collection tracking, or architectural analysis.\n\nThis class extends EntityHelper and inherits all methods for position tracking, entity identification, and world interaction, while adding painting-specific functionality for artwork analysis.",
