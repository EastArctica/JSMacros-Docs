  "description": "The PolarBearEntityHelper class provides specialized access to polar bear entities in Minecraft.",
  "overview": "It offers methods to monitor polar‑bear‑specific behaviors such as the bear’s aggressive stance (standing up to attack). This helper is a thin wrapper around the underlying PolarBearEntity Minecraft class and inherits all functionality from AnimalEntityHelper, MobEntityHelper, LivingEntityHelper, and EntityHelper.\n\nThis helper is useful for scripts that need to react to polar bears, for example warning the player when a bear is about to charge, or integrating polar‑bear‑related mechanics into custom automation.",
