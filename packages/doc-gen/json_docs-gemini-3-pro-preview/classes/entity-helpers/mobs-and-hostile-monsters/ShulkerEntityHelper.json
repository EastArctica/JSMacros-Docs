    "description": "The ShulkerEntityHelper class provides specialized access to shulker entities in Minecraft, offering methods to monitor and interact with shulker-specific behaviors such as their closed/open state, attachment position, and color.",

This helper is particularly useful for creating scripts that detect shulker positions, monitor their attack state, track shulker boxes in end cities, or analyze shulker behavior patterns during exploration or combat.",
