  "description": "Represents a phantom entity in the world. PhantomEntityHelper provides access to phantom-specific properties and behaviors such as size variations and attack patterns.",
  "overview": "Phantom entities are flying hostile mobs that appear in the Overworld after the player hasn't slept for at least three in-game days. They have unique behaviors like circling players, dive-bombing attacks, and varying sizes that affect their health and attack damage. This helper provides access to the specific phantom functionality beyond the general mob behaviors.\n\nThis class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all methods for health, movement, AI control, and other mob properties, while adding phantom-specific functionality for size management and behavior tracking.\n\nNotes and Limitations:\n- PhantomEntityHelper provides access to phantom-specific behaviors beyond general mob functionality\n- The `getSize()` method is crucial for understanding phantom strength and behavior patterns\n- Phantom size directly affects health points, attack damage, and collision box size\n- Size 0 phantoms are the smallest and fastest, while size 4 phantoms are the largest and most dangerous\n- Phantoms spawn after players haven't slept for at least 3 in-game days\n- Phantom spawning is affected by the current moon phase and player location\n- Phantoms will burn in sunlight unless they are in shade or water\n- Size-based attack patterns: smaller phantoms are more agile, larger phantoms hit harder\n- Phantom size cannot be changed after spawning - it's determined at creation time\n- Multiple phantoms can attack simultaneously, with coordinated diving patterns",
