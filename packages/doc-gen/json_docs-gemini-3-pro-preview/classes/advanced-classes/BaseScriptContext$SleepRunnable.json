    "since": "1.2.8",
    "description": "The SleepRunnable class is a specialized runnable implementation used within JSMacros for handling delayed or timed script execution. It encapsulates script execution logic that needs to run after a specified delay, enabling asynchronous operations, timed events, and delayed script continuations within the JSMacros scripting environment.",
    "overview": "The SleepRunnable class serves as a bridge between JSMacros' synchronous script execution model and asynchronous, timed operations. It provides: delayed execution of script code after specified time periods; integration with JSMacros' thread management system; safe execution context for delayed operations; support for both one-time and recurring delayed tasks; and proper resource management and cleanup for delayed executions. This class is primarily used internally by JSMacros for operations like Time.sleep(), Time.setTimeout(), and other timing-related functionality.",
