  "overview": "The StateHelper class is an abstract base class in JSMacros that provides a foundation for working with Minecraft state objects, particularly block states and fluid states. It offers a consistent interface for accessing and modifying state properties through string-based property names and values.\n\nSince this is an abstract class, you typically work with its concrete implementations:\n- `BlockStateHelper` - For block states with block-specific functionality\n- `FluidStateHelper` - For fluid states with fluid-specific functionality\n\nThe `StateHelper` class provides essential functionality for state management in JSMacros:\n- **Property Access**: Retrieve all state properties as a map of string key-value pairs\n- **State Modification**: Create new state instances with modified property values\n- **Type Safety**: Automatic validation of property names and values\n- **Immutable Operations**: All modifications create new state instances rather than modifying existing ones",
