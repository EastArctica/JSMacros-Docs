  "description": "Represents a Warden entity in the world. WardenEntityHelper provides access to warden-specific properties and behaviors such as anger levels, pose states, and special attack animations.",
  "overview": "The Warden is a blind but powerful mob that detects players through vibrations and scent. It has unique behaviors including emerging from the ground, sniffing to detect targets, roaring, charging sonic boom attacks, and digging back into the ground when not pursuing targets. The Warden's anger system determines its aggression level toward targets.\n\nThis class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all methods for health, movement, AI control, and other mob properties, while adding warden-specific functionality for monitoring and responding to the Warden's unique behaviors.",
