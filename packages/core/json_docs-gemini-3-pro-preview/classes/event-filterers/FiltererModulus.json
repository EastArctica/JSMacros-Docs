  "overview": "The FiltererModulus class is an event filterer that allows only every nth event to pass through, where n is the specified quotient. This is useful for reducing event frequency or sampling events at regular intervals. Instances are typically created through JsMacros.createModulusEventFilterer() or by using the constructor directly.\n\nImportant Notes:\n1. Event Type Agnostic: FiltererModulus can filter any event type.\n2. Counter Reset: The internal counter resets to 0 each time an event passes through.\n3. Positive Quotients: Negative values are automatically converted to positive values.\n4. Thread Safety: Maintains internal state and should not be shared across listeners unintentionally.",
