  "description": "The Profile class is the client-side implementation of JsMacros profile management for Minecraft. It extends BaseProfile with Minecraft-specific functionality including in-game error display, chat integration, client event registration, and thread management for the Minecraft client environment.",
  "overview": "The Profile class provides client-specific profile management capabilities including Minecraft integration for error reporting, registration of client-specific events (player, world, UI), thread safety management for the Minecraft main thread, and formatting of script errors into clickable chat messages. It also coordinates UI updates when profiles are switched and registers client-specific libraries.",
