  "overview": "The `BlockStateFilter` class is a specialized filter implementation in JSMacros' World Scanner system. It provides a way to filter block states based on their properties and methods by wrapping any public no-parameter method from the `BlockStateHelper` class and applying comparison operations to the returned values.\n\nThis class is typically not instantiated directly by users, but rather created through the `WorldScannerBuilder` when using state filtering methods like `withStateFilter()`. The filter leverages Java reflection to dynamically invoke methods on `BlockStateHelper` objects and compare their results using various criteria.",
