  "description": "The `PigEntityHelper` class provides specialized functionality for interacting with pig entities in Minecraft.",
  "overview": "This helper offers access to pig-specific properties including saddling status for riding capabilities, along with all the inherited functionality from animal entities for breeding and feeding mechanics. It extends `AnimalEntityHelper` and inherits comprehensive methods for managing animal behaviors, breeding compatibility, and food preferences.\nPigs are passive mobs that can be ridden by players when equipped with a saddle. They are bred using carrots, potatoes, and beetroots, making them valuable for food production and transportation in early game scenarios. Unlike horses, pigs require a carrot on a stick to steer while being ridden.\nThis class is typically obtained through entity events, world queries, or by casting from `EntityHelper` using the `asAnimal()` method when dealing with pig entities.",
