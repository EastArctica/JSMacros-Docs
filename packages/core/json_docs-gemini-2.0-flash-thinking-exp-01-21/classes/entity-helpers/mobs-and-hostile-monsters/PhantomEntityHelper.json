  "description": "Represents a phantom entity in the world. PhantomEntityHelper provides access to phantom-specific properties and behaviors such as size variations and attack patterns.",
  "overview": "Phantom entities are flying hostile mobs that appear in the Overworld after the player hasn't slept for at least three in-game days. They have unique behaviors like circling players, dive-bombing attacks, and varying sizes that affect their health and attack damage. This helper provides access to the specific phantom functionality beyond the general mob behaviors.\n\nThis class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all methods for health, movement, AI control, and other mob properties, while adding phantom-specific functionality for size management and behavior tracking.",

      "description": "PhantomEntityHelper instances are not typically created directly by scripters. Instead, they are obtained through: Entity-related events (e.g., `EntityDeath`, `EntityInteract`, `EntitySpawn`), World entity queries and type casting, Methods that return phantom entities, Type casting from EntityHelper using `entity.is(\"minecraft:phantom\")` and appropriate casting methods.",
