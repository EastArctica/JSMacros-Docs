  "description": "An event filterer that selectively filters `SendPacket` events based on packet type. This class allows you to create event listeners that only trigger for specific types of outgoing packets, reducing unnecessary event processing and improving performance.",
  "overview": "Filterers are used with event listeners to control which events trigger your handler functions. The `FiltererSendPacket` specifically works with the `SendPacket` event to filter based on the packet type name.",
