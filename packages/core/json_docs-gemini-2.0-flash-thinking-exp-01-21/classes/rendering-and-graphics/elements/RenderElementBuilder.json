  "overview": "The `RenderElementBuilder` is an abstract base class that provides the foundation for the builder pattern implementation in JSMacros' rendering system. It serves as the parent class for all specific render element builders (such as `Rect.Builder`, `Text.Builder`, `Line.Builder`, etc.) and provides common functionality for creating and adding render elements to 2D drawing contexts.\n\nThis class implements the builder pattern to allow for fluent, method-chaining configuration of render elements before their creation. It manages the relationship between the builder and its parent `IDraw2D` context, enabling both standalone element creation and automatic addition to the drawing context.\n\nThe `RenderElementBuilder` class exists to:\n\n1. **Standardize Builder Pattern**: Provide a consistent interface for all render element builders\n2. **Context Management**: Maintain the relationship between builders and their drawing contexts\n3. **Element Creation**: Handle the final creation of configured render elements\n4. **Automatic Integration**: Support both standalone element creation and automatic addition to drawing contexts\n\nThis abstract class is extended by concrete builder implementations including:\n\n- `Rect.Builder` - For creating rectangle elements\n- `Text.Builder` - For creating text elements\n- `Line.Builder` - For creating line elements\n- `Image.Builder` - For creating image elements\n- `Item.Builder` - For creating item render elements\n- `Draw2DElement.Builder` - For creating custom 2D elements",
