  "description": "The `BeaconInventory` class is a specialized inventory helper that provides access to Minecraft beacon screen functionality. It wraps Minecraft's beacon GUI and allows scripters to programmatically interact with beacon effects, select status effects, and apply beacon powers. This class is specifically designed for managing beacon operations when a beacon interface is open.\n\nThis class provides methods for examining beacon level, selecting primary and secondary effects, and applying chosen effects to players within the beacon's range.",
  "overview": "The `BeaconInventory` represents the interface to a Minecraft beacon block when its GUI is open. It provides access to beacon-specific operations such as:\n\n- Checking the current beacon level\n- Selecting primary and secondary status effects based on beacon level\n- Applying chosen effects to nearby players\n- Access to standard inventory operations through inheritance\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Beacon level detection (levels 1-4)\n- Primary effect selection for all levels\n- Secondary effect selection for level 3+ beacons\n- Effect application with payment validation\n- Integration with standard inventory operations",
