  "description": "Represents a ghast entity in the world. GhastEntityHelper provides access to ghast-specific behaviors, particularly their shooting state which determines when they are about to fire explosive fireballs at players. Ghasts are large, floating, white-colored hostile mobs found exclusively in the Nether that are known for their distinctive crying sounds and devastating fireball attacks.",
  "overview": "Ghasts are one of the most dangerous Nether mobs due to their ability to shoot explosive fireballs from a distance. They float through the air and will attack players on sight, opening their eyes and mouths to charge up before firing a fireball. This helper provides access to their current shooting state, which is crucial for predicting attacks and timing defensive maneuvers or counter-attacks.\n\nThis class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all methods for health, AI control, movement, and other mob properties, while adding ghast-specific functionality for attack state monitoring.",
