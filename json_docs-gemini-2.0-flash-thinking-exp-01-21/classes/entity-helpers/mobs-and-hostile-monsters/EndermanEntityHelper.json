  "description": "Represents an Enderman entity in the world.",
  "overview": "EndermanEntityHelper provides access to enderman-specific behaviors, states, and properties that are unique to the Enderman mob. This specialized helper allows you to monitor the enderman's aggression state, check if it's holding blocks, and track its provoked status. Instances are typically obtained from entity events, world entity queries, or by casting existing entity helpers that represent Endermen.",
