  "description": "Represents a bat entity in the world. Bats are flying passive mobs found in dark areas of the overworld, especially caves. BatEntityHelper provides access to bat-specific properties, particularly their resting state which determines whether they're hanging upside down or flying actively.",
  "overview": "Bats are nocturnal creatures that spend their days hanging upside down in dark places, using their echo location to navigate in the dark. At night, they emerge to hunt for small insects. They spawn in darkness (light level 0) and will not spawn in groups of more than 8 per area. When resting, bats hang upside down from ceilings or other solid surfaces.\n\nThis class extends `MobEntityHelper` and inherits all methods for health, AI control, movement, and other mob properties, while adding bat-specific functionality.",

Instead, they are obtained through:\n- Entity-related events (e.g., `EntityDeath`, `EntityInteract`, `EntitySpawn`)\n- World entity queries and type casting\n- Methods that return bat entities\n- Type casting from EntityHelper using `as(\"minecraft:bat\")` or appropriate casting methods",
