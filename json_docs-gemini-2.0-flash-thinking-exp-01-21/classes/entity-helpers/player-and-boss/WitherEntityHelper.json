  "description": "Represents a Wither boss entity in the world. WitherEntityHelper provides access to wither-specific behaviors, phases, and invulnerability states that are unique to the Wither boss mob. This specialized helper allows you to monitor the wither's combat phases, track its invulnerability periods, and understand its two-phase attack pattern.",
  "overview": "The Wither is a three-headed boss mob that goes through distinct phases: an initial invulnerable summoning phase and a second combat phase where it becomes immune to projectiles and aggressively pursues players. This class provides methods to track these states and respond appropriately during wither encounters.\n\nInstances are typically obtained from entity events, world entity queries, or by casting existing entity helpers that represent Withers.",
