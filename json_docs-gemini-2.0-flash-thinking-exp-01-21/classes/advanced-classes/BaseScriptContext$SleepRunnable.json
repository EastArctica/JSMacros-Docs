  "since": "JSMacros 1.2.8",
  "description": "The `SleepRunnable` class is a specialized runnable implementation used within JSMacros for handling delayed or timed script execution. It encapsulates script execution logic that needs to run after a specified delay, enabling asynchronous operations, timed events, and delayed script continuations within the JSMacros scripting environment.",
  "overview": "The `SleepRunnable` class serves as a bridge between JSMacros' synchronous script execution model and asynchronous, timed operations. It provides:\n\n- Delayed execution of script code after specified time periods\n- Integration with JSMacros' thread management system\n- Safe execution context for delayed operations\n- Support for both one-time and recurring delayed tasks\n- Proper resource management and cleanup for delayed executions\n\nThis class is primarily used internally by JSMacros for operations like `Time.sleep()`, `Time.setTimeout()`, and other timing-related functionality.",
