  "description": "The `ServiceStatus` enum represents the possible states of a service within the JsMacros ServiceManager system. Each status value provides information about both the enabled state and running state of a service, allowing for comprehensive service monitoring and management.",
  "overview": "The ServiceStatus enum provides a standardized way to track and query the state of services. Services can be independently enabled/disabled (which determines if they should run) and running/stopped (which indicates if they are currently executing). This dual-state system allows for services to be temporarily stopped without being disabled, or to be enabled but not currently running due to errors or manual intervention.",
