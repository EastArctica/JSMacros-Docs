  "overview": "When this event is fired, the event object payload contains the following fields:\n\n- `block` (Type: `BlockDataHelper`): A helper object containing information about the updated block. This includes the block state, block entity (if present), and position information. You can access the block's properties, position, and other data through this helper.\n- `updateType` (Type: `string`): The type of update that occurred for the block. Possible values are `'STATE'` (The block state changed, e.g., block type or properties) or `'ENTITY'` (The block entity data changed, e.g., chest contents, sign text).\n\n\nBehavior:\n- Fires when a block in the world changes state or its block entity updates.\n- The `updateType` field indicates whether it's a block state change or entity update.\n- Can be filtered using `FiltererBlockUpdate` to target specific blocks or update types.\n- Not cancellable.",
