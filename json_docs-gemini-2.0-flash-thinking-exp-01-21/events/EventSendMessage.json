  "overview": "This event fires when a message is about to be sent to the server. The `text` field contains the message that will be sent, and can be modified before the message is sent; changes will be reflected in the message that actually gets sent. This event is cancellable, preventing the message from being sent entirely. It is useful for message filtering, auto-correction, and command validation.",
