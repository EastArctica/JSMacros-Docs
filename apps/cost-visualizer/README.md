# @jsm-docs/cost-visualizer

A React application for visualizing the costs associated with the LLM-based documentation conversion process.

## Features

*   **Log Parsing**: Parses the `costs.txt` log file generated by `@jsm-docs/core`.
*   **Visualization**: Displays cost metrics, token usage, and generation time in interactive charts.
*   **Dashboard**: Provides a summary of total costs and per-model usage.

## Usage

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the dashboard.

### Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Preview

Preview the production build:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

## Data Source

The application expects a log file format compatible with the output of the `convert_docs.mjs` script in `@jsm-docs/core`. You can upload the `costs.txt` file directly in the UI.
