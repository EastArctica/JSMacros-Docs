AI_MAINTENANCE_INSTRUCTION: 
CRITICAL: This file acts as the Source of Truth for all automated agents and workflows in this repository.
You (the AI) are RESPONSIBLE for keeping this file in sync with the codebase.

You MUST update this file IMMEDIATELY and WITHOUT PROMPTING if you perform any of the following actions:
1.  **Modify Logic**: Change how `convert_docs.mjs`, `build-docs.mjs`, or any other automation script works.
2.  **Change Configuration**: Add/remove environment variables, CLI arguments, or change default models.
3.  **Add/Remove Agents**: Create new automation scripts, tools, or delete existing ones.
4.  **Update Capabilities**: Add new features (e.g., multi-threading support being added) or remove existing ones.
5.  **Refactor Architecture**: Move scripts, change package names, or alter the directory structure of these tools.

Do not ask for permission. If you change the code, you must change this documentation in the same turn.

**DISCREPANCY DETECTION**:
If you notice that this file is inaccurate based on the current state of the codebase (even if you didn't cause the change), you MUST:
1.  Inform the user about the discrepancy.
2.  Update this file to match the reality of the codebase.
